    tr395: Container-based Operating System Virtualization: A Scalable, High-performance Alternative to Hypervisors \cite{Containers}}

\maketitle

\section*{Paper Summary}

\textsl{3--5 sentences. Briefly summarise the {\bf contributions} of the paper,
i.e.,~what it adds over the state of the art. Paraphrase and extract the
essentials rather than simply copying chunks of text. Be objective; later
sections allow for your own opinion.}

The biggest contribution of the paper is the formalisation, description and
presentation of container-based systems for the academic community. It takes
the form of an analysis of a container-based system known as Linux-VServer
which has been in development since 2008 \cite{LinuxVServer}. The paper aims to
present a balanced view of the pros and cons of container-based systems
compared with alternatives such as hypervisors, whilst providing a technical
breakdown and evaluation of VServer itself.

\section*{Pros and Cons}

\textsl{6 bullets. Succinctly state three positives and three negatives of the
paper.}

Pros:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Comprehensive analyses of existing systems are valuable research in
    and of themselves - providing that for container-based operating systems
    gives this paper a lot of value.

    \item The paper pragmatically weighs up the pros and cons of
    container-based operating systems versus hypervisors, the goal is clearly
    to provide an overview and explanation of them instead of advocating for or
    against them.

    \item Pro 3

\end{itemize}

Cons:

\begin{itemize}

    \item The title is slightly misleading, although parts of the paper are
    about container-based operating systems in general - the focus is very much
    on one specific implementation: Linux-VServer.

    \item Some terms are introduced and never explained or referenced. A good
    example of this is \textit{the Grid}, which is repeatedly mentioned in the
    paper and something I have been unable to source.

    \item The paper is relatively unfocused due to its broad scope, (TODO: give
    justification).

    \item Linux-VServer hasn't really caught on, as its changes haven't been
    integrated into mainline
    Linux.

    \item In the evaluation, a statement is made describing the setup, but
    apart from the open source database tests thingy, not justification for the
    descisions are really given.

    \item There is an odd part of the evaluation (CPU Fair Share) where one of the
    VMs is given CPU reservation, a feature with Xen lacks. So it's kind of pointless.

    \item Evaluation only compares Xen, not the state of the art.

    \item The interesting case of containers in a virtualised enivornment isn't
    tested.

\end{itemize}

\section*{The Problem/Motivation}

\textsl{1--2 sentences per question. What is the motivation for the work, or
the problem being solved? Why is it important? If there is prior art, how was
it insufficient? If the problem had not previously been solved, why not?}

The motivation for the container-based operating systems which the paper
describes is how heavyweight virtual machines running on a hypervisor can be.
Although there are benefits to this, the paper argues that in some contexts
having many kernel instances (especially of identical kernels) is wasteful, and
a container based OS is a way to have a kernel shared by many different
pseudo-VMs. Arguments are also made that other overheads related to hypervisors
can be reduced or eliminated by using containers as well.

The work is important because of the explosion of VMs and hypervisors in data
centers \cite{VirtualizationGrowth}, and whilst the dramatic growth of them has
been driven by many benefits they provide, finding ways to reap similar
benefits whilst reducing some of the costs could be extremely valuable.

The prior art is what the paper describes, the systems being developed to solve
the problem the paper analyses are in constant development - incremental and
major gains are constantly being made in what is both an incredibly active area
of research and engineering. There are many different solutions to the
problems, each involving different trade-offs, a contributing factor to why
solving the problems described is so hard is because the nature of the problem
is constantly changing. Hardware, software, services, scale, what is expected, use cases,
alternatives, and more are constantly under flux, of which the systems being
described a singular apart.

\section*{The Solution/Approach}

\textsl{5--10 sentences. What have they done? How does it address the issues
set out above? How is it unique and/or innovative (if, indeed, it is)? Give
details, again using the paper as the source but again, not just copying text.
Instead, focus on paraphrasing/synopsising, and extracting the essential
details.}

The paper describes the main benefits of virtualization being those of
isolation. For example, many virtual machines running over a single hypervisor
are \textit{isolated} from each other in various ways. Whilst there are other
potential benefits to virtualization, which container-based operating systems
may not be able to provide, the paper focuses on how it is possible to provide
isolation between containers running on a singular kernel with the caveat being
that some of the stronger isolation guarantees hypervisors provide are exchanged
for higher efficiency.

The three types of isolation described are those of \textit{fault},
\textit{resource} and \textit{security} isolation. Linux-VServer, which the
paper describes, provides these through modifications to the Linux kernel which
allow for \textit{Fair Share} scheduling of various resources such as the CPU
and I/O. Interesting techniques are also used such as resetting the Virtual
Machine that uses the most memory when the swap has almost filled. In other
cases such as networking, limitations are introduced such as the inability for
VMs to change their own route table entries or IP tables rules - in exchange
for native Linux networking performance.

\section*{Evaluation}

\textsl{3--4 sentences. How do they evaluate their work? What questions does
their evaluation set out to answer? What does their evaluation say about the
strengths and weaknesses of their system? What is your opinion of the strengths
and weaknesses of the evaluation itself? Give highlights, not a point by point
reproduction of the evaluation section(s). In rare cases, systems papers may
not have any evaluation, in which case write `N/A' below.}

TODO

\section*{Your Opinion}

\textsl{At least 3 sentences. This is the fun part where you get to judge both
the paper and the work it reports! Is the motivation convincing? The problem
important? The approach a good or bad idea? Why? Which specific things annoyed
you, or you thought were cool, or cool-but-flawed? Justify your opinions! Make
an argument which will convince others of your opinion.}

TODO

\section*{Questions for the Authors}

\textsl{Finally, imagine you're attending a talk about this paper given by one
of the authors. Give at least 2 questions that you would like to ask, specific
to the paper and the research it reports.}

What do you think about the current state of containers and the different
options available?

What are the biggest challenges facing containers, and do you see any
convergence happening with virtualization technologies in the future?
