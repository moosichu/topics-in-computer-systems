\maketitle

\section*{Paper Summary}

\textsl{3--5 sentences. Briefly summarise the {\bf contributions} of the paper,
i.e.,~what it adds over the state of the art. Paraphrase and extract the
essentials rather than simply copying chunks of text. Be objective; later
sections allow for your own opinion.}


\section*{Pros and Cons}

\textsl{6 bullets. Succinctly state three positives and three negatives of the
paper.}


\section*{The Problem/Motivation}

\textsl{1--2 sentences per question. What is the motivation for the work, or
the problem being solved? Why is it important? If there is prior art, how was
it insufficient? If the problem had not previously been solved, why not?}



\section*{The Solution/Approach}

\textsl{5--10 sentences. What have they done? How does it address the issues
set out above? How is it unique and/or innovative (if, indeed, it is)? Give
details, again using the paper as the source but again, not just copying text.
Instead, focus on paraphrasing/synopsising, and extracting the essential
details.}


\section*{Evaluation}

\textsl{3--4 sentences. How do they evaluate their work? What questions does
their evaluation set out to answer? What does their evaluation say about the
strengths and weaknesses of their system? What is your opinion of the strengths
and weaknesses of the evaluation itself? Give highlights, not a point by point
reproduction of the evaluation section(s). In rare cases, systems papers may
not have any evaluation, in which case write `N/A' below.}


\section*{Your Opinion}

\textsl{At least 3 sentences. This is the fun part where you get to judge both
the paper and the work it reports! Is the motivation convincing? The problem
important? The approach a good or bad idea? Why? Which specific things annoyed
you, or you thought were cool, or cool-but-flawed? Justify your opinions! Make
an argument which will convince others of your opinion.}

\section*{Questions for the Authors}

\textsl{Finally, imagine you're attending a talk about this paper given by one
of the authors. Give at least 2 questions that you would like to ask, specific
to the paper and the research it reports.}
