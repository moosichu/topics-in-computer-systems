    tr395: ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems \cite{ZooKeeper}}

\maketitle

\section*{Paper Summary}

\textsl{3--5 sentences. Briefly summarise the {\bf contributions} of the paper,
i.e.,~what it adds over the state of the art. Paraphrase and extract the
essentials rather than simply copying chunks of text. Be objective; later
sections allow for your own opinion.}

The main contribution of the paper is the creation of ZooKeeper, a service that
can be used to coordinate the processes of distributed applications. The main
difference to existing services, which either focus on coordinating specific
distributed applications or provide locking primitives which can be used to
create coordination services, is that ZooKeeper exposes an API that allows for
the development of such primitives using a wait-free model.

Finally, the paper demonstrates how ZooKeepers \textit{coordination kernel} can
be used to build higher level primitives in addition to providing real-world
use cases of ZooKeeper that have been successful at Yahoo!.

\section*{Pros and Cons}

\textsl{6 bullets. Succinctly state three positives and three negatives of the
paper.}

Pros:

\begin{itemize}

    \item The paper is the \textit{best of both worlds} in that it not only
    describes and evaluates a real-world system that has been effectively used
    at a large scale, the source-code to the ZooKeeper itself has been
    published and open to usage and investigation by others.

    \item Pro 2

    \item Pro 3

\end{itemize}

Cons:

\begin{itemize}

    \item A lot of the details of the evaluation are missing, for example, such
    as: How many trials were run for each experiment? What is the variance in
    throughput? Are the benchmarks themselves publicly available for
    reproducibility?

    \item Although the evaluation mentions how ZooKeeper compares to the
    published results of other, similar systems, having the direct comparisons
    in the paper would have been good as so many variables could differ between
    different papers.

    \item Con 3

\end{itemize}

\section*{The Problem/Motivation}

\textsl{1--2 sentences per question. What is the motivation for the work, or
the problem being solved? Why is it important? If there is prior art, how was
it insufficient? If the problem had not previously been solved, why not?}

Coordinating distributed systems is a hard problem to solve, but one that is
constantly increasing importance due to the growth of internet services which
may even be distributed across the globe. The needs of different systems.

\section*{The Solution/Approach}

\textsl{5--10 sentences. What have they done? How does it address the issues
set out above? How is it unique and/or innovative (if, indeed, it is)? Give
details, again using the paper as the source but again, not just copying text.
Instead, focus on paraphrasing/synopsising, and extracting the essential
details.}


\section*{Evaluation}

\textsl{3--4 sentences. How do they evaluate their work? What questions does
their evaluation set out to answer? What does their evaluation say about the
strengths and weaknesses of their system? What is your opinion of the strengths
and weaknesses of the evaluation itself? Give highlights, not a point by point
reproduction of the evaluation section(s). In rare cases, systems papers may
not have any evaluation, in which case write `N/A' below.}


\section*{Your Opinion}

\textsl{At least 3 sentences. This is the fun part where you get to judge both
the paper and the work it reports! Is the motivation convincing? The problem
important? The approach a good or bad idea? Why? Which specific things annoyed
you, or you thought were cool, or cool-but-flawed? Justify your opinions! Make
an argument which will convince others of your opinion.}

\section*{Questions for the Authors}

\textsl{Finally, imagine you're attending a talk about this paper given by one
of the authors. Give at least 2 questions that you would like to ask, specific
to the paper and the research it reports.}
